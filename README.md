# Decision_Companion_System


Design and build a Decision Companion System that helps users make better real-world decisions.

The system must:

Accept multiple alternatives (options)

Accept multiple evaluation criteria

Support weighted importance of criteria

Evaluate options against criteria

Produce a ranked recommendation

Clearly explain why a particular recommendation was made

The system must:

Not be a hardcoded comparison

Allow changing inputs dynamically

Use explainable logic (not a black-box AI system)

AI tools may be used during development, but the core evaluation logic must remain transparent and justifiable.
